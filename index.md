### Introduction

This project started with the idea for a rocket landing game in which the user would user three controls (thrust, torque left, torque right) to steer a rocket from a random initial position and random initial angle (±30°).  From the initial idea for the game, came the thought of applying machine learning to optimize a neural network to land the rocket.  The input consists of a 0-5 integer corresponding to 3 booleans (thrust, torque left, torque right).  The input is enumerated as follows:


<div>
$$x_1 = x$$
</div>

<div>
$$x_2 = y$$
</div>

<div>
$$x_3 = \theta$$
</div>

<div>
$$x_4 = \dot{x}$$
</div>

<div>
$$x_5 = \dot{y}$$
</div>

<div>
$$x_6 = \dot{\theta}$$
</div>
